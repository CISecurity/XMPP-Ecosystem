# XMPP-Ecosystem
An XMPP-based implementation of the [SACM architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-arch/), enabling an ecosystem of connected components

A number of XMPP client implementations form the components of the architecture.  XMPP provides a secure communication channel between components, and its inherent extensibility allows clients to perform many SACM-related functions, such as:

- Orchestrator
- Collector
- Evaluator
- Repository


## Orchestrator ##
TBD

## Collector ##
TBD; either agent/host-based or remote capable

## Evaluator ##
TBD

## Repository ##
TBD; Policy repository, posture attribute repository, evaluation results repository, etc.

## XMPP Extension Protocols (XEPs) ##
TBD
- Service Discovery
- Entity Capabilities
- Publish/Subscribe
- File Transfer
- (?) File Repository & Sharing
- (?) Personal Eventing Protocol
